__**Risk Assessment**__  
Possible risks and constraints.
There is the inevitable possiblity of project members
facing outside constraints which could limit their ability
to work on the project.
We plan to address these factors in weekly project meetings, and to
manage the appropriately.
If we do face such a setback, we will assess the probablity of the 
project going over-budget and escaping the scope of the planning.
We will use expert judgement and quality data in the assessments.

__**Risk Assessment Update**__  
My project partner seems to have disappeared. Our productivity has dropped significantly,
expert judgement says about 40%. We have had to limit the number of iterations under
Agile Methodology, but will focus on quality of iterations and a working final product.
